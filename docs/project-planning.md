## DINE DASH APP
<!-- Italics -->
_Definition Statement-_
I want to build an application that will empower customers to place orders directly from their smartphones while seated at the table utilizing a “QR code ordering system” where customers scan a code on their table to access the digital menu and place their order directly on their phone.  This innovation streamlines the dining experience, reduces wait times, and minimizes the need for manual order taking by waitstaff.  By enhancing efficiency and giving customers greater control over their dining experience, the app can create a more enjoyable and seamless restaurant environment.  Additionally, it allows staff to focus on delivering exceptional service rather than managing order logistics, ultimately benefiting both customers and restaurant operations.

_Define Audience_- who is going to be using your application:
1.  Restaurant Diners: Tech-savvy customers who prefer convenience and efficiency during their dining experience, including young professionals, families, millennials, and generation z.
2.  Restaurant Owners/Managers: Business operators looking to streamline their service, reduce wait times, and improve customer satisfaction.
3.  Waitstaff: Employees who would benefit from reduced order-taking duties, allowing them to focus more on customer service.
This diverse audience will help ensure broad adoption and positive impact on both customer experience and operational efficiency. There will be monthly subscription for businesses to use app for their business.
